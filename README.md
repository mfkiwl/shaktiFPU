# SHAKTI Floating Point Unit

This repository contains the source code of SHAKTI's Floating Point Unit. This codebase has been silicon proven and has featured in two [processor tapeouts](http://shakti.org.in/tapeout.html): (i) RiseCreek, taped out in Intel's 22nm node, and (ii) RIMO, in SCL's 180nm node. More details on the synthesis results will be added soon.
